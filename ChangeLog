CHANGE LOG ENTRY 1 9/6/25
Creation & sizing
Add boards at runtime: add_board_mm(L, W, T) drops at mouse ground, honors snap.
Duplication: duplicate_active() with smart drop (mouse if over yard, else +X offset).
Resize hotkeys (with Shift):
Width: Shift+←/→
Length: Shift+↑/↓
Thickness: Shift+PgUp/PgDn
Remember last size: last_spawn_size_mm updates after add/resize.
Selection, alignment, snapping
Two-board face alignment (F): _align_pair_on_face() aligns B to A on hovered face.
Hover face overlay: translucent Quad on face under cursor.
Lift step adjust: [/] adjusts lift step; E/Q (or PgUp/PgDn) lifts active.

Input cleanup
Consolidated _unhandled_input:
Single path for mouse select, motion-drag update, and key handling.
Removed duplicate match blocks that caused earlier parse errors.

IDs, import, persistence
Deterministic IDs: _next_part_id() + _reset_part_ids() used on render/import.
Cutlist render: stable instance names, optional source label preserved.
Save/Load: ProjectIO.save_project / load_project round-trip instances + features.

Blueprint export
Cameras: _ensure_blueprint_cameras() creates CamTop/CamFront/CamSide (orthographic).
Framing: _compute_scene_aabb() + _frame_blueprint_cameras() (Godot 4 AABB.expand()).
PNG export: _export_blueprints() (V) captures each camera to PNG.
GLB export

Scene packaging: ProjectIO.export_glb_to(path) duplicates boards under WoodshopExport and writes GLTF.
HUD / UX
HUD base string fixed (no stray base variable): now hud_base.
Units flip: M toggles mm↔in display formatting.
Type-safety & parse fixes

Replaced := with explicit types where warnings were promoted to errors (e.g., _resize_active, alignment dictionaries).
Fixed AABB.expand_to → aabb = aabb.expand(point) (Godot 4).
Removed stray class-body lines that referenced hud_label (moved back inside functions).

Utilities
_opposite_face, _ground_point_at_mouse, _raycast solidified.
_reset_active_board() helper to rebuild CSG of active board when needed.
